DeepSeek reported training the R1 model for approximately $6 million, a fraction of the expenses incurred by other major AI firms. DeepSeek's open-source approach has garnered significant attention in the tech industry. Executives from major companies such as Alphabet, AMD, Palantir, and Amazon have discussed DeepSeek's impact on their businesses during earnings calls. While some praise its efficiency and innovation, others express concerns about potential security risks.However, DeepSeek has faced scrutiny over security and privacy issues. Experts have raised concerns about the app's data handling practices, including the transmission of unencrypted user information to servers controlled by ByteDance, a company with ties to the Chinese government. This has led to discussions about potential bans on the app from U.S. government devices due to national security concerns.Despite these challenges, DeepSeek continues to influence the AI landscape, prompting discussions about the balance between innovation, security, and international collaboration in technology development.
